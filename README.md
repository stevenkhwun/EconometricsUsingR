# Econometrics Using R

**IMPORTANT: This repository is still under construction and the contents are not complete and may not be accurate.**

This repository contains brief notes on the LSE external course EC2020 "Elements of econometrics" I have used R to implement the examples and exercises in the course.

The course text is Introduction to Econometrics by Christopher Dougherty (5th edition). The [companion website][Dougherty] contains the datasets and various supplementary materials.

A good reference is [Introduction to Econometrics with R][Intro] by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, and Martin Schmelzer.
